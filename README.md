# Quines

During the Coronovirus isolation at home, I was researching online and stumbled across somethign called a Quine.

A Quine is a computer prohram that takes no input, and produces a copy of its own source code as it's only output. This can also be known by the names: *'self-replicating'*, *'self reproducing'* or *'self copying'* programs.

I found this fascinating and decided to try and write a couple of basic ones using Ruby - Enjoy!
